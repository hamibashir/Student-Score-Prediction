# Student-Score-Prediction

📚 **Student Score Prediction**

A data science project that leverages **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours. This project explores the correlation between study time and performance, and visualizes predictive models using **Matplotlib**.

---

📌 **Project Overview**
Predicting student performance is a valuable task in the education sector to identify learning patterns and guide academic improvement. This project uses a dataset of student study hours and exam scores to:

* Explore and clean data
* Visualize study habits vs exam performance
* Apply both linear and polynomial regression models
* Evaluate and compare model accuracy

This hands-on project is ideal for beginners in machine learning and regression analysis.
